# Loan Approval Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview

This project implements a comprehensive machine learning analysis for loan approval prediction using a real-world dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation with multiple classification algorithms.

## üéØ Project Goals

- Predict loan approval status based on applicant characteristics
- Handle class imbalance using advanced sampling techniques
- Compare performance of different machine learning models
- Provide insights into factors affecting loan approval decisions

### Data Quality
- ‚úÖ **No missing values** in any feature
- ‚úÖ **Clean data structure** with proper data types
- ‚úÖ **Balanced feature distribution**

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Value Handling**: Filled categorical features with mode, numerical features with median
- **Feature Encoding**: Label encoding for categorical variables
- **Data Cleaning**: Stripped column names and standardized format

### 2. Model Training Pipeline
